  // This determines the quality of jpg images in the cbzfile. You want this as high

  // create much larger cbzfiles.
  "JpgQuality": 95,

  // MinimumDpi determines the minimum quality of the pages Ghostscript reads from the 
  // pdf. It's not recommended to set this lower than 300, and setting it higher can
  // cause the cbzfiles to grow very large. In other words, you probably shouldn't 
  // touch this. Note: to get the best possible result CbzMage will perform a dpi 
  // calculation to find out if it needs to read pages using a higher dpi value.
  "MinimumDpi": 300,

  // Sometimes reading pages using the MinimumDpi setting will create images that are 
  // much larger then the source pdf. CbzMage will detect this and scale the images 
  // down to prevent the cbzfile from growing too large - but it will not create 
  // images smaller than the MinimumHeight setting. The default is 1920 (HD).
  "MinimumHeight": 1920,

  // "NoCompression". The default is "Fastest" because jpg files in the cbz file are 
  // already compressed so "Optimal" gives very little difference in archive size.
