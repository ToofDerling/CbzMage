  // Pdf conversion can work in two modes: "Faster" and "Slower" (there is no
  // difference in quality between the two modes). Faster uses more memory as pdf 
  // pages are read to memory and converted before adding them to the cbzfile. 
  // Slower uses as little memory as possible as pages are saved to hard disk before 
  // adding them to the cbzfile. 
  "PdfConverterMode": "Faster",

  // Number of Ghostscript reader threads. Set this to 0 to have CbazMage try to
  // figure out a good value. If memory usage is too high you can either set this 
  // to a lower value or try the "Slower" mode mentioned above.
  "NumberOfThreads": 0,

  // The default buffersize is 4000000 (4 MB) which is a little larger then the 
  // average pagesize seen during testing (the buffers will be expanded as needed). 
  // This setting is mostly ignored when using "Slower" mode.
  "BufferSize": 4000000,

  // This determines the quality of jpg images in the cbzfile. You want this as high
  // as possible (90+). The default is 95 because a higher value causes CbzMage to 
  // create much larger cbzfiles.
  "JpgQuality": 95,

  // MinimumDpi determines the minimum quality of the pages Ghostscript reads from the 
  // pdf. It's not recommended to set this lower than 300, and setting it higher can
  // cause the cbzfiles to grow very large. In other words, you probably shouldn't 
  // touch this. Note that CbzMage will perform a dpi calculation to find out if it 
  // needs to read pages using a higher dpi value to get the best possible quality.
  "MinimumDpi": 300,

  // Sometimes reading pages using the MinimumDpi setting will create images that are 
  // much larger then the source pdf. CbzMage will detect this and scale the images 
  // down to prevent the cbzfile from growing too large, but it will not create 
  // images smaller than the MinimumHeight setting. The default is 1920 (HD).
  "MinimumHeight": 1920,

  // MaximumHeight is a hard cap at imagezize, again to prevent cbzfiles from growing
  // impossibly large. The default is 3840 (Ultra HD).
  "MaximumHeight": 3840,

  // Set the required minimum Ghostscript version. It's really not recommended to 
  // change this as some versions of Ghostscript below 10 didn't work properly when
  // running in parallel.
  "GhostscriptMinVersion": 10,

  // Compression level for the cbz file. Valid options are "Fastest", "Optimal" or
  // "NoCompression". The default is "Fastest" because jpg files in the cbz file are 
  // already compressed so "Optimal" gives very little difference in archive size.
  "CompressionLevel": "Fastest"
