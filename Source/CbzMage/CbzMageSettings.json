  "JpgQuality": 93,

  // MinimumDpi determines the minimum quality of the pages Ghostscript reads from 
  // the pdf. It's not recommended to set this lower than 300, and setting it 
  // higher can cause the cbz files to grow very large. In other words, you 
  // probably shouldn't touch this. 
  "MinimumDpi": 300,

  // Sometimes reading pages using the MinimumDpi setting will create images that
